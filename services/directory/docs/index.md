You will find data about Employees/Users in this api  

# Directory Api 
It is the Authentication and Authorization service.

User, once he logs in, gets one or more roles - Each role has 
- a key ( the secret)
- a code ( the human readable text to identify the user)
- set of permission(s).
- an organization (if role is of employment level)

In context of Axon (a tenant in the system) the organization is hospital/clinic.

For example:

A partner can be Admin cum Doctor in Fortis and a simple Doctor in Apollo - so he gets multiple roles.
A patient app user can have multiple roles (without organization) each corresponding to a family member.

The Apps at any point works under one role and uses the set of permissions in that role to show hide features.
